## Backend
If you would like to use this Launcher, it is recommended you use [Reload Backend](https://github.com/project-reload/reload-backend).
I will personally develop a **forked** reload for this Launcher soon, please be patient.
## Setup
In order to use the **Axis Launcher**, you must do the following:
1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh).
After installing bun, download the GitHub repository.
Then, extract your folder and run the "install.bat" file.
2. Install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
After installing Rust, you can go back to the extracted folder and run the "start.bat".

This will start the application. Usually, this can take some time on the first build.

## Building to Production
After configuring the Launcher, run the "build.bat" script. This will build the launcher into a ".exe" or a ".msi" which people can use to install the Launcher.

## How to configure the Launcher.
If you are new to Frontend Development, you can configure the Launcher in all components that AxisLauncher is mentioned.
